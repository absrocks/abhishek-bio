##### Role of coastal vegetation on tsunami energy attenuation
In this study, we numerically investigated the effect of flexibility of vegetation in tsunami wave energy attenuation implementing a two-way coupling FSI (fluid-structure interaction) model to understand the boundary layer dynamics and hydrodynamics of full-scale three-dimensional tsunami flow to optimize the design of nature-based solutions to reduce the tsunami risk.

##### CFD analysis to study the drag force of blue whale
Remora is a type of ray finned fish which have front dorsal fins by which they can adhere to the smooth surface, and they can spend their lives by clinging to a large host fish mammal body such as whale, shark etc. Hence to get the understand the adherence mechanism, and why Remora species prefer certain location of host fish body to adhere to, we conducted numerical analysis to get turbulent boundary layer characteristics to understand the drag mechanism around the whale body.
