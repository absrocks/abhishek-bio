Hello I am Abhishek, a doctoral student currently doing research on The role of
vegetation in coastal risk reduction at [NJIT](https://njit.edu) with
Dr. [Simone Marras](https://web.njit.edu/~smarras/). I primarily work on
numerical analysis of geophysical flows. I also have experience in
computational heat transfer.
